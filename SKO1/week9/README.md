**Week 9**

This week we really started to focus on our own projects in class, rather than learning to code through Karens 'Hour of Power'. 
It was so cool to start to see what everybody had been creating in the background over the past few weeks.

My goal this week was to really nail the class function, and make it work the way I wanted it to.
