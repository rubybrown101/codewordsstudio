**Week3: E-Lit**

This week we explored Electronic typography. E-Lit is typography designed for the screen, so can include sound and movement, and allows the designer to extend past the traditional definition of typography.

As a class we looked into different categories of E-Lit such as generetive type, chatbots, live coding and animated words. Being quite out of touch with the possibilities of coding and animation, this week was an exciting class and allowed me to further explore the possibilities of 'Slave to the Algorithm'. Below is a GIF buy Barney Mccann. I love how he places his audience in a position where they are only just able to recognise the letters and shapes, and only for a second at that, before he uses the platform to explore new and organic line in such a modern form of media. A true inspiration in the world of E-Lit!

During class we also entered into the (turns out to be) dark world of AI Dungeons. Our class somehow got into a cycle of the universe collapsing, and with Finn becoming the God of Death! 

Another student shared the link to Elias Hanzer's typeface generator, where you can alter the letters by selcting different typefaces and adjust the physical attributes through sliders. Below is an example of what I got playing around with!
