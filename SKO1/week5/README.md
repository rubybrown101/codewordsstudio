** Week 5!**

This week we got to view all of the other groups assignments, I loved the variety of the works and how differently everyone chose to tell the story. It was great to see how passionate every obne was about their chapter, and to see the effort that had gone into each piece. 

Although a little confronting, I loved how our chapter turned out. I think Ferg, Hamish, Celia and I worked together very well as a group and were able to tell the story through the penguins and the setting, as well as the use of after effects quite effectively.
