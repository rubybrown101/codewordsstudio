**Week 11**

This week in class we continued to work on our final projects in class. We broke up into breakout rooms where we could solve our problems with other students, 
and with Karen and Andy when they were free. This weeks discussions were so helpful, and made me relax a bit when I was really not too happy with where my sketch was at.

After having separate discussions with Karen and Celia, I decided that i should simplify my sketch and just work with what I knew. This was a bit daunting, especially after seeing how insane the other students works were turning out! During class I simplified my sketch, and ensured the words bounce only inside the box initially.

This is where I was at the begining of class, I got the box to swivle with the mouse, but the words were still bouncing around the whole page rather than just inside the box. At this stage I was still trying to break the sentence down into letters, over the class I decided to leave it as the whole word and work on the more important structual and visual aspects of the assignemnt. Have a play around with sketch [here](https://rubybrown101.github.io/codewordsstudio/SKO1/week11/newbox1/)

Here the sketch works better visually, the colours are less in your face and work together better. The words are also staying inside the box until you hold down your mouse (yay)! although dissapoitning, after a few weeks of being stressed I wouldn't figure out how to work the code the way I would like, it is very much a relief to accept the simplified version. Have a play around with this sketch [here](

Time to simplify further and see where we end up!
