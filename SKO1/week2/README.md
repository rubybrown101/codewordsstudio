**Hello and welcome to week2!**

This week we entered the world of Modular Typography, and what an exciting world it is! Modular Typography can be defined as 'an alphabet constructed from a limited amount of shapes'.  
We studied typographers and there work, such as Theo van Doesburg, Jurriaan Schrofer and Phillipe Apeloig. I have attached some of there works below.
