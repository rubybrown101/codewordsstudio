**Hello and Welcome to week2!**

This week we entered the world of Modular Typography, and what an exciting world it is! Modular Typography can be defined as 'an alphabet constructed from a limited amount of shapes'.  

We studied typographers and there work, such as Theo van Doesburg, Jurriaan Schrofer and Phillipe Apeloig. I have attached some of there works below. 

Theo van Doesburg was a Dutch artist, who practiced in the late 19 Century to early 20 Century.  He was a part of the 'De Stijl' group who believed in making universal language, focusing on the horizontal and verticle lines and primary colours. Below is the cover of the first 'De Stijl' magasine, designed by Van Doesburg. It is suggested that his co-worker Vilmos Huszar helped on the cover.
