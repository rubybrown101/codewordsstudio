As this was my first introduction to coding ever, I was really excited to learn all about the platform and see what it had to offer. We went throught the basics such as createCanvas, choosing your background, creating basic shapes and the use of (mouseX, mouseY) (I was in awe of this!!). Although extremely daunting, it was great to get into p5.js and see what we could do. For homework, we were to create our initials on the platform, which is what you can see above.
