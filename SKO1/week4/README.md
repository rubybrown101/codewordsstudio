**Week 4**

This week in class we started working with type in p5.js. We learnt about the preload function which allowed us to use differnt typefaces within the sketch. This was really exciting for me, as it felt as though we were making movements in our learning! We were also introduced to the spinning feature, and were taught how to adjust it with radius and degrees. Below is my sketch of the week or click [here](https://rubybrown101.github.io/codewordsstudio/SKO1/week4/typetest)!

Reflecting on this week, I think it was probably the start of where I really started to struggle with the platform. While I thought I understood everything that was going on, and was so excited to learn about this new way of designing, looking back while designing my final assignment I realised there were so many basics that went over my head. 

**Assignment 2**

This week we started to act out the scenes in Club Penguin, and realised the games limitations with custimising the game to fit the story. The lack of emotion shown from the penguins, and diversity of setting made it challenging to convey quite a deep and intimate story through a very childish and fun game, and made us revise how we were going to convey the true story. After a fair bit of discussion, we decided to use the different mini games within Club Penguin to display each seperate setting, and the use of effects in post-recorded editing to convey the story how we wanted to.
